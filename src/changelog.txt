MRBW-WIFI Firmware Changelog

-----------------------------------------------
1.0.6 (2c3e76) - 29 May 2023

BUG FIX: FR switch didn't actually cause a factory reset of the internal
 configuration drive / config.txt file.  Also turn the status LED blue to indicate
 that the internal filesystem is being rewritten to factory defaults (in all cases, 
 not just when the FR switch is set)

-----------------------------------------------
1.0.5 (e221c8) - 29 May 2023

BUG FIX: Fix issue where receiver would crash when disconnecting from a command
 station if the wifi network had failed / gone away.

FEATURE: Better support for DCC-EX by separating it out as its own command station
 type and implementing specific quirks (such as not supporting force function 'f')

-----------------------------------------------
1.0.4 (c5984b) - 22 May 2023

FEATURE: Added EVENT handling to the ESU code, such that if another 
 throttle updates the same engine selected on the PT, we'll respond appropriately.

FEATURE: Added JMRI fast clock support.  Setting "fastClockSource = cmdstn" 
 in the configuration file will tell the mrbw-wifi to use fast time from any sort 
 of withrottle server.  Yes, that includes the LNWI.  However, the LNWI doesn't 
 disappoint as the glitchy little gremlin that it is, and its support for sending 
 fast time seems to be "special" at best and broken at worst.  However, JMRI 
 works flawlessly as best I can tell.

FEATURE:  Added duplicate PT receiver detection.  If you have two PT receivers 
 on the same base address, you'll now get an asterisk instead of a B in front 
 of the base addr on the screen, and the LED will blink green -> cyan -> green 
 on a 1s interval.

FEATURE: Added display of both the receiver's IP address and the command station /
 server that it's trying to connect to.  An L: on the front end means it's the 
 local address, a C: means it's the command station IP/port.  These cycle on 
 a 2 second interval so you can see both.

CLEANUP: Cleaned up serial console logging and added the ability to set the log 
 level in the config.txt file so that you can turn up the logging if we run into 
 a problem we can't duplicate.  

-----------------------------------------------
** 1.0.3 (c2c668) - 20 May 2023

BUG FIX: Withrottle driver directions reversed
